# island-madness
Island Madness is a survival game built with jQuery and HTML5. 

#Premise:
You are ship wrecked on an island. The island is full of plants in various stages of growth.
You score points by surviving longer. Things are sped up, and plants grow, but you mostly have to manage very limited resources. Since plants at various stages of growth have different uses, you have to ensure that you have plants at various stages of growth to use, because using all of them may mean the resource is no longer available or depleted all together.
There are no rivers, and trying to swim only brings you back to the island some days later.
The sea can be fished, but requires bamboo string, harpoon or a net.

Bamboo:
*Shoots can be eaten.
*Young stems can be eaten if well cooked.
*Used for cord and poles.

*	Fruit can be eaten.
